# Getting-and-cleaning-data-week-4-assignment
Starting this assignment, we got a folder of data with 2 separated part of training and testing dataset, 
#each comprised of 3 smaller parts 
#X - which is the main data body comprosied of coordinate for each 3-dimension movement
#Y - which indicate the type of action 
#sub -  indicate to which subject the actions belonged to.

## The main purposes of the run_analysis.R script:
1. Merge the training and test data sets to create 1 single data set
2. Extract only the measured mean & standard deviation
3. Name the activities 
4. Labeled variable names
5. Creates a independent secondary data set with the mean of data grouped by activities and subjects

## The content of CodeBook.md included: 
1. Description of the data
2. Description of the variables
3. Transformation performed to tidy up the data

### The file tidy.txt is the independent secondary data set resulted from the 5th tasks of the run_analysis.R script
